When I was developing the Post feature (the layout that you're reading right now), I encoutered a problem with creating the Table of Content (TOC) component. How to set this up? How to export headers in MDX contents to the TOC component? Today, I will help you to achieve that in Gatsby.

> Note: In this post, I mainly focus on implementing the TOC component into the site. I will not focus on creating a layout or a page, but the final project could be found [here](https://github.com/richardnguyen99/)
